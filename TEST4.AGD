; Spectrum Next AGD Game Compiler skeleton program
; Jonathan Cauldwell, February 2018

; Define the play area in character/block cells
; Screen is divided into 32 columns and 24 rows (Spectrum and Next/Timex) or 25 rows (CPC)
; The 4 parameters for DEFINEWINDOW are top edge, left edge, height and width respectively

DEFINEWINDOW    1 1 22 30

; Background blocks to be used in the game
; First we define the type - eg EMPTYBLOCK, PLATFORMBLOCK or DEADLYBLOCK
; Next 16 numbers are alternating graphic and attribute bytes from top to bottom

; Block 0

DEFINEBLOCK     EMPTYBLOCK      ; property

; Sprites
; First argument defines the number of frames
; Then 32 bytes for each sprite frame (Spectrum and Timex) or 80 bytes (CPC).

; Screen layouts are best arranged in monospaced rows and columns
; DEFINESCREEN is followed by the block numbers that make up the screen
; Our play area is 22x22, so we need 22 rows of 22 columns
; The compiler will automatically compress screens

; Next we define the sprites that appear on the screen
; SPRITEPOSITION requires 4 numbers for image, type, Y coordinate and X coordinate in that order
; Coordinates are based on Spectrum screen, even for CPC so need to change for conversions

SPRITEPOSITION 0,0,88,128


; Define objects
; Spectrum: First number is attribute, then the starting room, next 2 are for Y and X coordinates then 32 for image.
; Timex: First number is the starting room, next 2 are for Y and X coordinates then 32 for image.
; CPC: First number is the starting room, next 2 are for Y and X coordinates then 80 for image.
; Coordinates are based on Spectrum screen, even for CPC so need to change for conversions

; Spectrum:

; Map.
; First argument is WIDTH, second is the startscreen
; We then arrange the map as a grid with correct width, monospaced here for readability
; where no room is present we put 255
